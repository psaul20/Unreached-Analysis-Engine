# Unreached-Analysis-Engine

This project is meant to be a collaborative learning effort for all who are interested in developing insights around engagement with Unreached People Groups around the world. Unreached People Groups are defined by the (https://joshuaproject.net/help/definitions#unreached "Joshua Project") as "less than or equal to 2% Evangelical Christian and less than or equal to 5% Professing Christians." This threshold is understood to be the minimum requirement needed in order for a sulf-sustaining movement of Christian disciple-making within a people group (a distinct ethnic unit with shared history, language, and culture).

Initially, the vision for this application is the following:
* Experiment with Python libraries for data analysis and visualization (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc.) to analyze and visualize extensive data sets gathered by the Joshua Project
* Develop methods for time-series analysis of changing Christian engagement amongst UPGs, indicating the potential presence of a budding movement
* Implement these methods using Joshua Project APIs and other tools available via cloud provided via AWS, MS Azure, etc. to run analysis on an event-based basis, building up an analytics base over time

In the long-term, we may explore the following:
* Identification of key indicators strongly correlated to the development of UPG movements over time, both currently captured by Joshua Project or otherwise
* Implementation of Machine Learning and other AI-based methods to predict the potential for budding movements around the world
* Sharing of this information amongst churches and parachurch organizations to bring greater focus and clarity to UPG outreach

Initial set of tools to be explored as part of this effort:
* Anaconda python data analysis platform
* Python data analysis libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy
* AWS event-based application infrastructure (EC2, Lambda, etc.)

Feel free to share this with any friends who may be interested in helping out. All are welcome!!

In Him,
